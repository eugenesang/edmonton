                    <p>It's important that you're successful when you’re ready to sell. Sadly, more than half of all MLS
                        listings end with excuses and frustration rather than a sale. The result is changes to your life
                        plans, and unexpected costs if you’re forced to own 2 homes at once. This is why we've built a
                        better plan designed to guarantee your success and make the entire process stress-free!</p>

                <div class="q-icon"><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></div>
            </div>
            <div class="a">We've built the Swift Sale to pay 90% of current market value. Even if we re-sell the home for more than what was originally valued, you'll get a second payment for the full 90% of that overage! A common misunderstanding about Edmonton Real Estate Experts is to think of us as 'house flippers' who buy low to sell high and keep all the profit. We don't make 'low-ball' offers because we're not house flippers. Our business model is a fee for service. The service we provide is the certainty of a sale without the hassles of a listing and all the showings. The fee we charge is 10% of value, which includes our commissions, costs, and all other fees.</div>

                <div class="q-icon"><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></div>
            </div>
            <div class="a">Let us know. If you think something was missed, we'll review it with you and make sure that we understand your homes full value. We normally set the asking price higher, and often sell the homes we buy for more than what’s appraised. If this happens on the home you sell to Edmonton Real Estate Experts, you get 90% of the overage too.</div>

                <div class="q-icon"><i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></div>
            </div>
            <div class="a">Yes. Sometimes our homes receive competing offers from more than 1 buyer and the result may be a sale at more than the asking price, and more than the appraised value. If we can sell the home for more than the appraised value, you'll get a second payment for 90% of the overage too!</div>

We apply our finances to make our customers' selling and buying process easier, and more profitable. Edmonton Real Estate Experts makes an offer to buy your home – unlike other real estate brokerages that only offer to ‘list’ your home on the local MLS, you can activate our offer to skip showings. If you want to test the market with an MLS listing before activating our offer, you can do that – you don’t pay anything to ‘list’ with Edmonton Real Estate Experts and only pay a discounted commission if/when you sell.</div>

            <div class="a">We get this question almost every day, actually. There's really no catch. When you want to sell, you want the process to be as easy as possible, and a fair selling price. We lead with an offer to buy your home! You can activate our offer for a moving day that works best for you. We pay 90% of appraised value PLUS 90% of any overage. The value is set by an independent appraisal. You can activate our offer and skip showings. You may also test the market for a higher sale price before activating our offer – if you choose.</div>
