                        <div class="a">We've built the Swift Sale to pay 90% of current market value. Even if we re-sell
                            the home for more than what was originally valued, you'll get a second payment for the full
                            90% of that overage! A common misunderstanding about Trusted Advisers Realty is to think of
                            us as 'house flippers' who buy low to sell high and keep all the profit. We don't make
                            'low-ball' offers because we're not house flippers. Our business model is a fee for service.
                            The service we provide is the certainty of a sale without the hassles of a listing and all
                            the showings. The fee we charge is 10% of value, which includes our commissions, costs, and
                            all other fees.</div>

                        <div class="a">Let us know. If you think something was missed, we'll review it with you and make
                            sure that we understand your homes full value. We normally set the asking price higher, and
                            often sell the homes we buy for more than what’s appraised. If this happens on the home you
                            sell to Trusted Advisers Realty, you get 90% of the overage too.</div>

                        </div>
                        <div class="a">Yes. Sometimes our homes receive competing offers from more than 1 buyer and the
                            result may be a sale at more than the asking price, and more than the appraised value. If we
                            can sell the home for more than the appraised value, you'll get a second payment for 90% of
                            the overage too!</div>

                            finance, and technology. We apply our finances to make our customers' selling and buying
                            process easier, and more profitable. Trusted Advisers Realty makes an offer to buy your home
                            – unlike other real estate brokerages that only offer to ‘list’ your home on the local MLS,
                            you can activate our offer to skip showings. If you want to test the market with an MLS
                            listing before activating our offer, you can do that – you don’t pay anything to ‘list’ with
                            Trusted Advisers Realty and only pay a discounted commission if/when you sell.</div>

                        <div class="a">We get this question almost every day, actually. There's really no catch. When
                            you want to sell, you want the process to be as easy as possible, and a fair selling price.
                            We lead with an offer to buy your home! You can activate our offer for a moving day that
                            works best for you. We pay 90% of appraised value PLUS 90% of any overage. The value is set
                            by an independent appraisal. You can activate our offer and skip showings. You may also test
                            the market for a higher sale price before activating our offer – if you choose.</div>
