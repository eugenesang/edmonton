                                once. The freedom to set/change your sale date also lets you avoid selling your home
                                without having a home to move into which often results in putting things in storage and
                                renting for a period of time, then moving again. We help you avoid that and save on
                                these expenses!</p>

                        that overage! A common misunderstanding about Edmonton Real Estate Experts is to think of us as
                        'house flippers' who buy low to sell high and keep all the profit. We don't make 'low-ball'
                        offers because we're not house flippers. Our business model is a fee for service. The service we
                        provide is the certainty of a sale without the hassles of a listing and all the showings. The
                        fee we charge is 10% of value, which includes our commissions, costs, and all other fees.</div>

                        sure that we understand your homes full value. We normally set the asking price higher, and
                        often sell the homes we buy for more than what’s appraised. If this happens on the home you sell
                        to Edmonton Real Estate Experts, you get 90% of the overage too.</div>

                        result may be a sale at more than the asking price, and more than the appraised value. If we can
                        sell the home for more than the appraised value, you'll get a second payment for 90% of the
                        overage too!</div>

                    <div class="a">Edmonton Real Estate Experts is a licensed real estate brokerage, blended with
                        finance, and technology. We apply our finances to make our customers' selling and buying process
                        easier, and more profitable. Edmonton Real Estate Experts makes an offer to buy your home –
                        unlike other real estate brokerages that only offer to ‘list’ your home on the local MLS, you
                        can activate our offer to skip showings. If you want to test the market with an MLS listing
                        before activating our offer, you can do that – you don’t pay anything to ‘list’ with Edmonton
                        Real Estate Experts and only pay a discounted commission if/when you sell.</div>

                        want to sell, you want the process to be as easy as possible, and a fair selling price. We lead
                        with an offer to buy your home! You can activate our offer for a moving day that works best for
                        you. We pay 90% of appraised value PLUS 90% of any overage. The value is set by an independent
                        appraisal. You can activate our offer and skip showings. You may also test the market for a
                        higher sale price before activating our offer – if you choose.</div>
